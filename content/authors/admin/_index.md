What are the factors which contribute to a flexible intelligence, and how do they arise?
How is information represented, computed, and utilized in the brain? Why is our brain
so much better than man-made machines and AI? I’m broadly interested in such topics
in theoretical neuroscience where physics, biology and machine learning meet.
