      * Data analysis and model development on human decision-making in complex tasks.
      Several parameter-efficient models were built which reached high performance on predicting participantsâ€™ choices.
      * Simulating neural spiking and finding correlations between criticality in brain and
      different consciousness states of coma.

        * Analyzing visual system model with information theory. Different learning pace were
        found for different parts of the model, which could help further understand and improve
        existing algorithms.
